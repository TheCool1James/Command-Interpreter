# Command-Interpreter
Program Command Blocks like you do with a regular programming language!  
I have a habbit of commiting too often. IDK if its a good habbit (maybe if you lose everything).  
*Warning:* Contains some dirrrttyy code :grin:
## Project files:
ProgramInterpreter <- Contains the GUI components of the program  
InterpreterEngine <- The heart of it all. Contains all the wacky interpretations and etc...  
For now, only Windows users can enjoy this tool.  :unamused:
### You can find the documentation at the project site!
(If you are still alive after reading them that is) :smirk:

I'm kinda addicted to the emojis now. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
