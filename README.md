# Command-Interpreter
Program Command Blocks like you do with a regular programming language!  
I have a habbit of commiting too often. IDK if its a good habbit (maybe if you lose everything).  
*Warning:* Contains some dirrrttyy code (performance is not a priority right now) :grin:
## Project files:
ProgramInterpreter <- Contains the GUI components of the program  
InterpreterEngine  <- The deprecated interpreter engine  
libIL2AIL          <- New and shiny engine. Uses the .NET Roslyn library to parse the code  
For now, only Windows users can enjoy this tool, and this is not going to change unless the Roslyn engine becomes cross platform, and someone comes and ports my code to other platforms.
### You can find the documentation at the project site!
(If you are still alive after reading them that is) :smirk:

I'm kinda addicted to the emojis now. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
